You may also ask that we limit the information we give to someone who is involved in your care, such as a family or friend. Please note that we are not required to agree to your request. If we do agree, we will honor your limits unless it is an emergency situation.</li>
          <li>Ask that we communicate with you by another means. For example, if you want us to communicate with you at a different address we can usually accommodate that request. We may ask that you make your request to us in writing or update your member profile. We will agree to reasonable requests.</li>
          <li>Request a copy of your PHI. We may ask you to make this request in writing and we may charge a reasonable fee for the cost of producing and mailing the copies, or review your member profile.
