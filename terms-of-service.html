        <h4>I. Introduction and Eligibility</h4>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service (<strong>"Terms"</strong>) carefully before using the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p>These Terms include OpenTreatment's <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. We have included several annotations in boxes to help explain the legal jargon and emphasize key sections. These annotations are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
        <p>This agreement is a legally binding contract. It may change as our business changes, and you agree you will review it and any updates regularly.</p>
        <p><strong>Binding Agreement.</strong> These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and OpenTreatment LLC and its affiliates and subsidiaries (<strong>"OpenTreatment," "we," "us"</strong>). <strong>"You"</strong> and <strong>"users"</strong> shall mean all health service providers and their agents who use the OpenTreatment Service. You accept these Terms by clicking the "I agree" checkbox when you download or install the OpenTreatment Service, when you agree to them using our website at <a href="//www.opentreatment.com">www.OpenTreatment.com</a>, and each time you access the OpenTreatment Service thereafter. If you do not accept these Terms, you must not use the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Revisions to Terms.</strong> We may revise these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to this web page. You should visit this page periodically to review the most current Terms, because you are bound by them. Your continued use of the OpenTreatment Service after a change to these Terms constitutes your binding acceptance of these Terms.</p>
        <p>The terms <strong>"post"</strong> and <strong>"posting"</strong> as used in these Terms shall mean the act of submitting, uploading, publishing, displaying, or similar action on the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p><strong>"Health-related information"</strong> means all individually identifiable health information, including demographic information and information related to an individual's physical or mental health, the provision of health care to the individual, or the individual's payment for the provision of health care.</p>
        <p><strong>"Health service provider"</strong> means an entity that provides health-related services.</p>
        <h4>II. The OpenTreatment Service</h4>
        <p>The <strong>"OpenTreatment Service"</strong> is defined as any computer or mobile application or software under OpenTreatment's control, whether partial or otherwise, in connection with providing the services provided by OpenTreatment. The OpenTreatment Service provides a platform to store health- related information to make it available to you and your employees.</p>
        <p>OpenTreatment does not give medical advice.</p>
        <p><strong>Medical Advice.</strong> OpenTreatment does not give medical advice. The OpenTreatment Service may provide helpful information to assist you in medical decision-making. The information and materials available through the OpenTreatment Service are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to constitute professional advice, diagnosis or treatment, or to substitute for your professional judgment. You assume full risk and responsibility for the use of information you obtain from or through the OpenTreatment Service. You will be solely responsible for the professional and technical services you provide. In addition, we do not recommend or endorse any provider of health care or health-related products, items, or services.</p>
        <p>You agree to comply with any additional terms required by our third-party vendors and suppliers, as necessary, to use parts of the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> The OpenTreatment Service may include certain third-party software and services. Your use of such software or services may require that you enter into separate subscription or licensing agreements with third-party vendors and suppliers. You agree to comply with and, upon request, execute such agreements as may be required for the use of such software or services.</p>
        <p>You may allow employees to use the OpenTreatment Service on your behalf. You may allow patients to use the OpenTreatment Service to pay for your services.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for the use and misuse of the OpenTreatment Service by the employees and patients you allow to access the OpenTreatment Service using your account.</p>
        <p><strong>No Third-Party Access.</strong> Except as required by law and described below, you will not permit any third party to have access to the OpenTreatment Service using your account. You may allow your employees to use the OpenTreatment Service on your behalf in compliance with these Terms. You may also allow patients to make payment for your services through the OpenTreatment Service in compliance with these Terms. You are solely responsible for the use of the OpenTreatment Service by your employees and patients. We have no liability for the consequences to you or your employees or patients from your or their use of the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Responsibility for Misuse by Other Users.</strong> You acknowledge that by allowing employees and patients to access the OpenTreatment Service with your account, you are responsible for ensuring such employees and patients use the OpenTreatment Service for the purposes for which they are accessing it. While the OpenTreatment Service has certain technical safeguards against misuse, you acknowledge it will rely to a substantial extent on your responsible use. You agree that we will not be responsible for any unlawful access to or use of the OpenTreatment Service by any employee or patient to whom you gave access or log-in credentials. You agree that you are responsible for ensuring that health-related information is properly protected under applicable law.</p>

        <p><strong>Individuals' Consent for Data Collection and Use.</strong> You represent and warrant that you have obtained the proper consents, authorizations, and releases from individuals to the fullest extent required by applicable law before posting their health-related information to the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Exporting Information from the OpenTreatment Service.</strong> You are solely responsible for any health-related information exported from the OpenTreatment Service by you or the employees and patients that you allow access from your account.</p>
        <p><strong>Training and Compliance.</strong> You agree to train all employees on the use of the OpenTreatment Service, HIPAA or health privacy obligations, and the requirements of these Terms and ensure that they comply with such requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Compulsory Information Disclosure.</strong> You will promptly notify us of any order or demand for compulsory disclosure of health-related information if the disclosure requires access to or use of the OpenTreatment Service. You will cooperate fully with us in connection with any such demand.</p>
        <h4>III. OpenTreatment's Health-Related Information Practices</h4>
        <p>OpenTreatment voluntarily complies with the requirements of the <strong>"Privacy Rule"</strong> and <strong>"Security Rule"</strong> as defined by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH Act").</p>
        <p>We may use and disclose health-related information to provide our services.</p>
        <p>We may use de-identified health-related information as permitted by law.</p>
        <p><strong>Use and Disclosure.</strong> We may use and process the health-related information posted to the OpenTreatment Service for the proper management, provision, and administration of the OpenTreatment Service and our business, and as required by law. We may also disclose health-related information if required by law or we obtain reasonable assurances from the recipient that such information will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which we disclosed it. You agree that OpenTreatment may use and share de- identified health-related information to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Transfers at Your Request.</strong> We do not transfer health-related information to third parties, other than our vendors, suppliers and as required to process patient billing. We may transfer health-related information to third parties, including health plans, health-care clearinghouse, and others. You authorize us to make such transfers upon the request of you and the users who are acting under your account. You acknowledge that when you consent to transferring the information to third parties, we have no control over how those third parties will use and disclose the information.</p>
        <p>We will use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of health-related information other than as provided for by these Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Appropriate Safeguards.</strong> We will use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of health-related information other than as provided for by these Terms, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information.</p>
        <p><strong>Security Incident.</strong> We will report to you any discovered use or disclosure of health- related information not provided for by these Terms, or when we determine that unauthorized access to health-related information has occurred.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Agents.</strong> We will ensure that any of our agents, suppliers, and vendors to whom we provide health-related information for purposes of assisting us in providing the OpenTreatment Service, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to us with respect to such information, including the obligation to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards.</p>
        <p><strong>Access, Amendment, and Accountings.</strong> We will facilitate your requirements under the Privacy Rule to give patients access and the ability to amend health-related information you posted to the OpenTreatment Service. We may also facilitate an accounting of disclosures as required by the Privacy Rule.</p>
        <p><strong>Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") Audits.</strong> We will give HHS access to our internal practices, books, and records related to the use and disclosure of health- related information for the purposes of determining your compliance with the Privacy Rule.</p>
        <p>The OpenTreatment Service retains the information you post to it for compliance and regulatory purposes and will cooperate with you regarding requests to delete information. We will provide you copies of health-related information in electronic form if you decide to terminate your use of the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Termination of these Terms.</strong> At the termination of these Terms we will provide you with a copy of health-related information in an electronic form that is accessible through commercially available hardware and software. If feasible, we will also return or destroy all health-related information you or your employees or patients post to the OpenTreatment Service. If such return or destruction is not feasible, we will continue to abide by these Terms with respect to such information and limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return or destruction of the information infeasible. You acknowledge that segregating health-related information for removal from the OpenTreatment Service may be infeasible.</p>
        <p><strong>Security Rule.</strong> We will comply with the provisions of the HIPAA Security Rule that are made applicable to business associates. We will notify you of the discovery of any breach of health-related information that we store and we will cooperate reasonably with you to investigate and mitigate any such breach. We will provide you with the necessary information to make any legally required notification to individuals.</p>
        <h4>IV. Account Creation and Secure Credentials</h4>
        <p>If you create an account on behalf of a health service provider, you agree you have the authority to do so and that you are binding the health service provider.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for your log-in credentials and for keeping your account information accurate.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for any activity resulting from the use of your log-in credentials on the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p>You agree that if you create an account and use the OpenTreatment Service on behalf of a health service provider, you have the necessary legal authority and capacity to do so as an authorized agent of the health service provider. Such health service provider will be the primary account holder. You agree that you have the authority to bind the health service provider in legal agreements and contracts. Your agreement to these Terms also binds such health service provider.</p>
        <p><strong>Owner of Account and Health-Related Information.</strong> The primary account holder (i.e., health service provider) holds the legal rights to the OpenTreatment Service account and the information posted to the OpenTreatment Service by your business entity.</p>
        <p><strong>Accurate Account Information.</strong> You represent and warrant that the information you provide to OpenTreatment upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also represent and warrant that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times.</p>
        <p><strong>Verification.</strong> You agree that we may take steps to verify your identity and credentials as a health service provider at any time. You agree that we may use and disclose information, including "Confidential Information," about you for such purposes, including making inquiry of third parties concerning your identity and professional and practice credentials. You authorize such third parties to disclose to us such information as we may request for such purposes, and you agree to hold them and us harmless from any claim or liability arising from the request for or disclosure of such information. You agree that we may terminate your access to the OpenTreatment Service at any time if we are unable at any time to determine or verify your qualifications or credentials.</p>
        <p><strong>Protecting Your Log-In Credentials.</strong> As a registered user, you will have log-in information, including a username and password. Your account is personal to the primary account holder, and you may not share your account and log-in information with, or allow access to your account by, any third party. As you will be responsible for all activity that occurs under your account and access credentials, you should take care to preserve the confidentiality of your username and password, and any device that you use to access the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p>You agree to notify us immediately of any breach in secrecy of your log-in information. If you have any reason to believe that your account information has been compromised or that your account has been accessed by a third party, you agree to immediately notify OpenTreatment by e- mail to <a href="mailto:support@opentreatment.com">support@OpenTreatment.com</a>. You will be solely responsible for the losses incurred by OpenTreatment and others (including patients) due to any unauthorized use of your account that takes place prior to notifying OpenTreatment that your account has been compromised.</p>
        <h4>V. Communications</h4>
        <p>OpenTreatment may communicate with you by email or by posting notice on the OpenTreatment Service. You may request that we provide notice of security breaches in writing.</p>
        <p>You agree to receive email from us at the email address you provided to us for informational and customer service-related purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Electronic Notices.</strong> By using the OpenTreatment Service or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the OpenTreatment Service. If we learn of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the OpenTreatment Service or sending an email to you.

        <p>The contents of the OpenTreatment Service include: designs, text, graphics, images, video, information, logos, button icons, software, audio files, computer code, and other OpenTreatment content (collectively, <strong>"OpenTreatment Content"</strong>). All OpenTreatment Content and the compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of all OpenTreatment Content are the property of OpenTreatment or its licensors and are protected under copyright, trademark, and other laws.</p>
        <p><strong>License to You.</strong> We authorize you, subject to these Terms, to access and use the OpenTreatment Service and the OpenTreatment Content solely for the use of OpenTreatment's services, at our discretion. Any other use is expressly prohibited. This license is revocable at any time without notice and with or without cause.

Without our prior written permission, and except as solely enabled by any link as provided by us, you agree not to display or use in any manner the OpenTreatment Marks.</p>
        <h4>VII. Confidential Information</h4>
        <p><strong>"Confidential Information"</strong> means all confidential information disclosed by a party (<strong>"Disclosing Party"</strong>) to the other party (<strong>"Receiving Party"</strong>), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Your Confidential Information shall include the data you post to the OpenTreatment Service, <strong>not</strong> including health-related information; OpenTreatment Confidential Information shall include the OpenTreatment Service, customer feedback, and information relating to the performance, reliability, or stability of the OpenTreatment Service, operation of the OpenTreatment Service, know-how, techniques, processes, ideas, algorithms, and software design and architecture; and Confidential Information of each party shall include business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.</p>
        <p><strong>Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> The Receiving Party shall (i) use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event less than reasonable care), (ii) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of these Terms, and (iii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its affiliates' employees, contractors and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections no less stringent than those herein.</p>
        <p><strong>Compelled Disclosure.</strong> The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.</p>
        <h4>VIII. Intellectual Property Rights and Your License to Use</h4>
        <p>You, or the people who allow you to use their content, own all of the content you create using the OpenTreatment Service. However, we may use it for any purpose, including in our marketing materials. We may also modify your content to make it work better on the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p>It is very important that you have permission to use other people's content or they may be able to sue you for violating their legal rights.</p>
        <p><strong>OpenTreatment Claims No Ownership.</strong> The OpenTreatment Service may provide you with the ability to create, post, or share content (<strong>"Your User Content"</strong>). OpenTreatment claims no ownership over Your User Content. You or a third-party licensor, as appropriate, retain all copyright, patent, and trademark rights to any of the content you post on or through the OpenTreatment Service. You are responsible for protecting those rights. You also acknowledge and agree that Your User Content is non-confidential and non-proprietary.</p>
        <p><strong>OpenTreatment's Use of Posted Content on the OpenTreatment Service.</strong> By creating, posting, or sharing Your User Content on or through the OpenTreatment Service, and subject to OpenTreatment's Privacy Policy, you grant OpenTreatment a perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, modify, remove, publish, transmit, or display Your User Content for any purpose, including for the purpose of promoting OpenTreatment and its services. You waive any rights you may have regarding Your User Content being altered or manipulated in any way that may be objectionable to you. OpenTreatment reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any User Content in its sole discretion.</p>
        <p><strong>You Acquire No Ownership of Others' Content.</strong> You understand and agree that you will not obtain, as a result of your use of the OpenTreatment Service, any right, title, or interest in or to such content delivered via the OpenTreatment Service or in any intellectual property rights (including, without limitation, any copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or other rights) in the content.</p>
        <p><strong>You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post.</strong> You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the content posted by you on or through the OpenTreatment Service or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms, (ii) the posting and use of Your User Content on or through the OpenTreatment Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights, or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of Your User Content on the OpenTreatment Service does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of content you post on or through the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <p>The OpenTreatment Service contains content from users and other OpenTreatment licensors. Except as provided within these Terms, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any content appearing on or through the OpenTreatment Service.</p>
        <h4>IX. Copyright Policy</h4>
        <p>Let us know if you think a user has violated your copyright using the OpenTreatment Service, or if you think someone incorrectly reported that you violated his or her copyright.</p>
        <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the <strong>"DMCA"</strong>) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the OpenTreatment Service infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send OpenTreatment a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;</li>
          <li>Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the OpenTreatment Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</li>
          <li>Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow OpenTreatment to locate the material on the OpenTreatment Service;</li>
          <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);</li>
          <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
          <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send OpenTreatment a counter-notice.</p>
        <p>Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/">http://www.loc.gov/copyright/</a> for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the OpenTreatment Service should be sent to <a href="support@opentreatment.com">support@OpenTreatment.com</a>. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. Section 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
        <h4>X. Suggestions and Submissions</h4>
        <p>Do not send us your ideas for a new business or functionality. If you do, we can use them without compensating you.</p>
        <p>OpenTreatment appreciates hearing from its users and welcomes your comments regarding the OpenTreatment Service. Please be advised, however, that OpenTreatment does not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, inventions, or materials (<strong>"creative ideas"</strong>) other than those which we have specifically requested. While OpenTreatment values your feedback on our services, please be specific in your comments and do not submit creative ideas. If, despite this request, you send OpenTreatment creative ideas, OpenTreatment shall:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>own, exclusively, all now known or later discovered rights to the creative ideas;</li>
          <li>not be subject to any obligation of confidentiality and shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any creative ideas; and</li>
          <li>be entitled to unrestricted use of the creative ideas for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to you or any other person.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>XI. User Content Disclaimers, Limitations, and Prohibitions</h4>
        <p>We do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of content, posted by users ("User Content"). You accept that any reliance on material posted by other users, vendors, or suppliers will be at your own risk.</p>
